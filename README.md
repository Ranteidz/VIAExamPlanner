The system represents a betterment for the current fallible method of planning examinations
of VIA University College. The system allows the user to input all the necessary data to book
an examination for a specific date (students, classrooms, examiners, and courses), and, at
the same time, avoids conflicts and checks the input information.

Based on the interview with the customer, 19 functional requirements and 3 non-functional
requirements have been developed. The system meets all the important functional
requirements: 16 of the 19 requirements have been successfully implemented, while the rest
could be implemented in the future.

The programming language used for this project was Java. The program uses JavaFX for the
Graphical User Interface and the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API to connect to the
database.

Upon starting, the system loads all the data from the database into memory and all the
processing is done locally. The database is updated every time there is a change in the data.
After testing, the system proved to be faultless, there are not any unhandled exceptions,
therefore no unforeseen errors which might occur.
